# Comparing Electoral Systems
A repo for running simulations of voting processes and comparing different electoral systems on top of that.
For all the collaborators: try to keep the code clean, easily readable and soundly commented,
remember about the doc-string at each function and PEP 8 general suggestions:
https://realpython.com/python-pep8/
(all docs: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Always fetch/pull and solve possible conficts before pushing anything, so our computers stay happy.
